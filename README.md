# Enhancing Recommendation Systems: A Comparative Analysis of Multimodal Feature Representations 

- Explored multimodal recommendation systems by integrating text, image, and metadata features through deep 
learning-based fusion techniques, and conducted a comparative analysis of modality combinations to address 
the cold-start problem. 

- Co-authored as part of a collaborative research project during undergrad. Gained hands-on experience in 
academic writing, model evaluation, and presenting research findings at a national-level conference.
